Angular Material tabs organize content into separate views where only one view can be
visible at a time. Each tab's label is shown in the tab header and the active
tab's label is designated with the animated ink bar. When the list of tab labels exceeds the width
of the header, pagination controls appear to let the user scroll left and right across the labels.

The active tab may be set using the `selectedIndex` input or when the user selects one of the
tab labels in the header.

<!-- example(tab-group-basic) -->

### Events

The `selectedTabChange` output event is emitted when the active tab changes.

The `focusChange` output event is emitted when the user puts focus on any of the tab labels in
the header, usually through keyboard navigation.

### Labels

If a tab's label is only text then the simple tab-group API can be used.

<!-- example({"example": "tab-group-basic",
              "file": "tab-group-basic-example.html"}) -->

For more complex labels, add a template with the `mat-tab-label` directive inside the `mat-tab`.

<!-- example({"example": "tab-group-custom-label",
              "file": "tab-group-custom-label-example.html",
              "region": "label-directive"}) -->

### Dynamic Height

By default, the tab group will not change its height to the height of the currently active tab. To
change this, set the `dynamicHeight` input to true. The tab body will animate its height according
 to the height of the active tab.

 <!-- example({"example": "tab-group-dynamic-height",
               "file": "tab-group-dynamic-height-example.html",
               "region": "dynamic-height"}) -->

### Tabs and navigation
While `<mat-tab-group>` is used to switch between views within a single route, `<nav mat-tab-nav-bar>`
provides a tab-like UI for navigating between routes.

 <!-- example({"example": "tab-nav-bar-basic",
               "file": "tab-nav-bar-basic-example.html",
               "region": "mat-tab-nav"}) -->

The `tab-nav-bar` is not tied to any particular router; it works with normal `<a>` elements and uses
the `active` property to determine which tab is currently active. The corresponding
`<router-outlet>` can be placed anywhere in the view.

### Lazy Loading
By default, the tab contents are eagerly loaded. Eagerly loaded tabs
will initalize the child components but not inject them into the DOM
until the tab is activated.


If the tab contains several complex child components or the tab's contents
rely on DOM calculations during initialization, it is advised
to lazy load the tab's content.

Tab contents can be lazy loaded by declaring the body in a `ng-template`
with the `matTabContent` attribute.

 <!-- example({"example": "tab-group-lazy-loaded",
               "file": "tab-group-lazy-loaded-example.html",
               "region": "mat-tab-content"}) -->

### Label alignment
If you want to align the tab labels in the center or towards the end of the container, you can
do so using the `[mat-align-tabs]` attribute.

 <!-- example({"example": "tab-group-align",
               "file": "tab-group-align-example.html",
               "region": "align-start"}) -->

### Controlling the tab animation
You can control the duration of the tabs' animation using the `animationDuration` input. If you
want to disable the animation completely, you can do so by setting the properties to `0ms`. The
duration can be configured globally using the `MAT_TABS_CONFIG` injection token.

 <!-- example({"example": "tab-group-animations",
               "file": "tab-group-animations-example.html",
               "region": "slow-animation-duration"}) -->

### Accessibility
`MatTabGroup` and `MatTabNavBar` implement different interaction patterns for different use-cases.
You should choose the component that works best for your application.

`MatTabGroup` combines `tablist`, `tab`, and `tabpanel` into a single component with
handling for keyboard inputs and focus management. You should use this component for switching
between content within a single page. 

`MatTabNavBar`, implements a navigation interaction pattern by using a `<nav>` element with anchor
elements as the "tabs". You should use this component when you want your cross-page navigation to
look like a tabbed interface. As a rule of thumb, you should consider `MatTabNavBar` if changing
tabs would change the browser URL. For all navigation, including with `MatTabNavBar`, always move
browser focus to an element at the beginning of the content to which the user is navgating.
Furthermore, consider placing your `<router-outlet>` inside of a
[landmark region](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#dfn-landmark) appropriate to the page.

Avoid mixing both `MatTabGroup` and `MatTabNavBar` in your application. The inconsistent interaction
patterns applied between the components may confuse users.

#### Labels

Always provide an accessible label via `aria-label` or `aria-describedby` for tabs without
descriptive text content.

When using `MatTabNavGroup`, always specify a label for the `<nav>` element.

#### Keyboard interaction

`MatTabGroup` implements the following keyboard interactions.

| Shortcut             | Action                     |
|----------------------|----------------------------|
| `LEFT_ARROW`         | Move focus to previous tab |
| `RIGHT_ARROW`        | Move focus to next tab     |
| `HOME`               | Move focus to first tab    |
| `END`                | Move focus to last tab     |
| `SPACE` or `ENTER`   | Switch to focused tab      |

`MatTabNavBar` does not add additional keyboard handling, deferring to the native behavior of
anchor elements.
