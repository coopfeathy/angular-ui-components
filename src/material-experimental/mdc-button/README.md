### TODO
- Determine coloring for non-primary buttons (MDC does not support this)
- Write README - looks like lot of overlap with checkbox README. Create common readme for setup
- Move tests over (both unit and e2e)
- JSDoc comments on all classes, consts
- Consider supporting button[mat-outlined-button]
- Add to universal app
- Consider if we want to add a "appearance/type" input to button, similar to form field (outline/stroked, flat, raised)
