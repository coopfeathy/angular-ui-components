### Open Issues

- Disabled FAB does not look disabled
- Anchor button does not look disabled
- No focused state
- Icon buttons are not colored by theme

### TODO
- Write README - looks like lot of overlap with checkbox README. Create common readme for setup
- Move tests over (both unit and e2e)
- JSDoc comments on all classes, consts
- Consider supporting button[mat-outlined-button]
- Add to universal app
- Should each button type have a unique top level class? e.g. mdc-mat-icon-button
- Consider if we want to add a "appearance/type" input to button, similar to form field (outline/stroked, flat, raised)
